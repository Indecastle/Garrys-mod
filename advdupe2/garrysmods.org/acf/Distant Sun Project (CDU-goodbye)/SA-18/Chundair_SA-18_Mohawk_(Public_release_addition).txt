#NOTE: AS ALWAYS GIVE CREDIT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU MADE. Do not try and use the main helicopter E2. find the original release yourself on facepunch (by versus) or get from a mate. this one is custom settings so it will not work for any thing of yours

-Pros:
made without visclip
Array of weapons loadouts, you only get the A1 variant though:(
4 x 14.5mm ray of death to unarmored vehicles
FFAR has HEAT warheads can deal hurt to tanks.
7 passangers
Ammo hopefully safe to smallarms fire
Can tow and hoist objects (Sorry i got rid of this feature on the public version opps :))

-Cons:
no convergence on the Mgs. hard to aim horizontally with only the effect of two hitting the target
FFARs are innacurate aswell
No armor. ITS A HELI FOR GOODNESS SAKE STOP KILLING THE FUN BY PUTTING 140mm+ CHEESE ON YOUR AIRCRAFTS they arnt heavy tanks
slow, sluggish
