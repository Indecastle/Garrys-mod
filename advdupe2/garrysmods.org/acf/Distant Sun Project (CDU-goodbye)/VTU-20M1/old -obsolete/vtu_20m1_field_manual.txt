#VTU-20M1 By ChunderDownUndeR.
#Field manual
#Public tank. distripute, repaint or reverse engineer but ffs give credit for the tank itself.

"The Desire to replace the obsolete VTU-10 and VTU-20 fire support ifvs with a newer, similar design, firepower and durability
airborne amphibious vehicle in the 10-20 range without compromise to firepower led to a project to make a contempory counterpart
that would be the successor of either the VTU-20 or lighter weight VTU-10. The outcome is the VTU-20M1 with tank destroyer 
counterparts. Unfortunately the weight surpassed the max tonnage limit slightly but was continued anyway (max 20 with a preferable 15t)
The result of this added weight was due to the substancally increased firepower boasted by the VTU-20M1. which features
8 weapon presets, including two seperate ATGM systems and CQC anti-infantry weapons"

"The VTU-20M1 BlackSnake is much similar to its previous (Also public dupe) VTU-10 predecessor in mobility but trades some 
durability for a significantly increase of firepower and a array of weapons that outstand in different situations"
