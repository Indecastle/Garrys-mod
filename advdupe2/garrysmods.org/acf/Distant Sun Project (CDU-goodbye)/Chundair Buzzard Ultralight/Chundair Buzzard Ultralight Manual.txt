#---Info
"

Buzzard weighs 0.5t to 0.85 t
millitrary version is armed with a 12.9 and twin 40mm GL
10 min of fuel
top speed of 62 mph

E2s 
NOTE: Please do not reverse enginner the E2s or claim anything as your own. i setup the E2s so they are deliberately hard to 
customize the settings. if you want to use the E2 your going to have to talk to me about it.
DO NOT USE THE STARK E2 IN YOUR AIRCRAFT THIS IS MY CUSTOM E2 I WORKED VERY HARD ON if you want to use starks jet e2 you can
find it on his yt channel. stealing the E2 for your own purpose destroys my incentive to release public dupes

Stakrs Jet Engine (CDUMOD)- dont tanke this one for your creation. find the original. i set it up so you shouldnt be able to take it
Integrated plane E2-bespoke
