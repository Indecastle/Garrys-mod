Hello!

As i promised i fixed the HDV HA-20 Wheeled tank destroyer since its disappointment is overwhelming.
in basic summary it can now go up hills and its turret will no longer wobble; two of its worst flaws.
there is a new google drive folder for it.

Changes made:

"Turret now has a dedicated base prop instead of the the gate being the turret base. Both which are now propnotsolid(legal)"
-This change stops all the awful spasm and ustism that caomes when firing or moving on rough and bumpy ground which sends the turret in a fit its not gone completelty but reduced to point where it isnt noticable.

"downforce part of eztank movment is now local to base insteaad of world down (meaning that it push the base plate down and create grip relative to the base's downwards angle)"
-This has increased its inclination rate from basically 0 to a bit more than 0 (yes its still bad but it can go up basic terrain).
