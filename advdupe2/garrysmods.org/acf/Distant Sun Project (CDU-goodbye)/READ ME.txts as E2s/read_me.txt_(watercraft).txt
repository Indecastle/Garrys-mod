#To propel aircraft from the launching ramp, you have 10 seconds to sit them in the middile of the yellow/grey broken lines
#and wait until the plane is attacked and the ramp is up to throttle up your plane

#Arresting cable
#the arresting cable should automatically snap to your planes wheel or physical prop but has a chance to fail. when your
#plane is hooked to a cable it will slow down drastically and let go 5 seconds later

#APAPI 
#On the left part of the rear of the exended landing deck is the APAPI that will lead your planes to a safe landing

#2 Red -            too low angle of attack
#2 White -          too high angle angle of attack
#1 of each -        ideal angle of attack
