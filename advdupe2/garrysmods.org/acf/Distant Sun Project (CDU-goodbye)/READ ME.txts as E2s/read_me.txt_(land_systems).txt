#Ugly minmax tanks



#By Default the driver and gunner pod are linked to the same vehicle (Right hand or middle seat) for single man control.
#However by locating and relinking the driver pod to another seat inside the vehicle you can have split driver gunner controls
#there are atleast 2-3 seats inside each vehicle.
#Vise versa applies: if you dont have friends and the vehicle (eg: canebrake 8x8) that has split controls for 2 seats you
#can locate the driver pod and link it to the gunner or commander seat.

#Some tanks have commander RWS systems. by default the left most seat. this is its own seat and pod linked and can not be operated by default unless there is someone sitting there.

####HDV C-LAV , C-LAV AT####
"Utility Light Car with little protection, shares same chassis as Perentie, Gunner control is seperate by default"



####HDV Canebrake Modular 8x8#####
"A unique concept to create a versatile combate vehicle. a flatbed 8x8 with the ability to retrofit modular units on the
battlefield. The controls are a bit of a mouthful but its worth every minute of it."

#Driver Seat is front, Commander Seat is right side.
#By default the controls for commander and driver are split into 2 pod controlls for 2 seat but can be linked to one
#very easily. Commander can remote control whatever module unit is attached but controls will be overwritten if someone
#is sitting in the modular unit's main gunner seat.

#to attach modular units drive the flatbed roughly underneath them and press Q in driver seat. make sure your in connecting range

#All the modulars are in a sepperate folder in the dupe/drive file

#Missiles are SACLOS guided but only able to target seafaring vehicles



####HVSS-20/Long-155####
#**Has additional controls

"By Far my most favorite vehicle i have made. I am proud of this one inparticular. The Long155 is a unique artillery piece
That can fire conventional HE or top Attack GLATGMs from Line of sight or by automonously designated fire from another vehicle
Although this is my favorite unit. it surprsinly doesnt fully work in either ACF 2 or 3. 3 due to smaller ammo gun distance
and Acf2 GLATGMs are currently broken and wont do any damage"

#Driver seat (Middle):

#Gunner seat (rear right)

####TZU-75-1/-2####
"7t Tankette. Tankettes are fun!"



####VT-62/VT-62M1####
"A light APC vehicle. Basically a BTR-40. Gunner and driver seats are split on all variants except the APC version"
#APC Has a MCLOS Weapon. Use arrow keys the steer the ATGM



####VTU-10AM1####
"A very old(duoe wise) and very low profile rocket  tank destroyer. ATGM means it wont work on ACF3 without fixing it first"



####VTU-20-105M1/M2 Frillneck####
"NOTE: this is a older iteration of the VTU-20M1 Blacksnake with a less powerful engine and physical gun (not holoturret)"



####VTU-30/M1####
"This was suppose to be a testbed for a stowable independant RWS turret that was never finished. the tank is similar to a mbt70"



####VTU-74 SPRG####
"Self Propelled recoilless rifle vehicle. the lack of gun traversal and elevation means you need to rely on the hydraulic suspension"



####VTU-76 II Series####
"Early boom and zoom  recon vehicles for fun!. variants include 105mm gun, 120mm gun launcher and 130mm srpg. might not work on acf3"



####VTU-80 Akuma Series####

#Universal Radar controls:
#Space. Toggle Radar
#Pointing your mouse at a vehicle will show on HUD if its being tracked. Firing your gun on a tracked target causes the
#Gun to Auto-Lock when being fired. Server addons or certain constraint methods cause tracking to be unreliable sometimes
#DUE TO UNIVERSAL RULE VIOLATIONS BOTH RADARS ARE ILLEGAL! GET CONSENT BEFORE A FIGHT TO DEPLOY THEM



####VTU-85 WaterDragon####
"Might not work at all anymore. Prototype recon twin recoilless vehicle. Shift fires atgm"



####VTU-90NG ####
"Modernized VTU-90. Illegal (acf3) due to invisible armor around the tracks."



#VTU-99-120TD** (H,HA)
#**Has additional controls

"Minmax and illegal to ACF3. But thats ok because it wont ever work on 3 due to the aim-mobility being tuned to 2.
This is a experimental twin gun tank destroyer with dual axis guns and hydraulic suspension and hull aiming"
#Note: The guns are physical so would cause more lag then usual.

#Controls:
#Space -            Aim Hull when not moving.
#Mouse1 (hold) -    Sustained ROF

#Fire control might be broken. but the hull should aim to whatever gun will fire next. holding mouse will fire the guns at
#a sustained ROF.



####The other ungly minmax vehicles####

#Im not bothering writing descriptions or controls for the other more minmax tanks. They shouldnt be any different 
#to the controls above anyway. and i doubt the majority of you will actually USE them because they are illegal to acf3 rules
#and probably working poorly on ACF3 anyway.
