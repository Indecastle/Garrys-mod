#Overview
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Hello. Im CDU. The Project to create a wargame E2 started as a when people kept asking me to make 'captureable points' and 'Team HUDs'

With the Alpha version as of this moment im typing has over 900 lines of coding. the E2 provides a simple but fun
Multi-player team combat. Even without ACF or other mods or PVP it can be used!
Most of the gameplaye is inspired by other wargames like Warthunder and WGRD. which will be elaborated on below.

The scope of this wargame in ACF is that it creates a new meta option for acf combat, using the entirety of gmod maps, mobility,
stealth and cunning of an individual and his vehicle where weight can be diverse and teamplay is vital to winning.
Contrary to the 'meta' Flat-ground point blank slug fests the majority of clantards defend so dearly.

The 'Wargame' is omni-purpose E2 with different gamemodes and game options to customize the gameplay to a certain niche or liking
"

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#General Game options
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Game Options are provided in the E2 code up top, to customize how the game works to your liking"

#--Gamemode

#-Mode Types:
#0 - No mode type (Elimination to win)
#1 - Destruction - WG RD - read the rules E2
#2 - KOTH - WT - read the rules E2
#3 - Domination - CDU - Read the rules E2

#--No mode
#No extra winning criteria to the game. 
#Check the setting 'Elimination=1' to have a standard acf fight. Overwise the game has no winning or losing criteria

#--1-Destruction
#Destruction gameode similar to Wargame: RedDragon
#Score is given souly to the destruction of the enemy team. A player kill can be detemined by following settings in the E2.
#A vehivle kill can be determined by its weight in Kg or a given point in following settings
#Objective points are purely for refil points.

#--2-KOTH
#Destruction with Points granting a score income similar to Warthunder
#Points are given to player and vehicles kills and each point owned by the team.

#--3-Domination
#Simply the team to first capture all bases wins


#--ScoreLimit
#The team to first exceed the given score limit wins the game

#--TimeLimit (in minutes)
#The time limit of the game. if a team has half the required score limit and 150% or more of the other teams score they win
#otherwise a draw is executed to both teams
#Set to 0 to have unlimited time. the timer will count upwards in that case.

#--KillPoint
#team's Points awarded towards killing a player (infantry) on the enemy team 
#If the person killed has been in a vehicle it counts as a vehicle kill and the weight or set points for giving
#Set to 0 for no points to be rearded for killing an enemy person

#--PointsInWeight
#If set to anything over than 0, the total mass of a vehivle is the score given to the opposite team.
#NOTE: Unless you have access to prop protection of entire both teams (Or admin privlages) it is best to set this to 0 as it wont work
#Points for vehicle kills are rewarded once there owner of the vehicle has sat in the seat has died  
#Vehicle kill is added to Killpoint instead of overiding

#--VehicleKillPoint
#if PointsInWeight = 0, The set score given to the team who has killed an enemy player that has used in a vehicle that he owns
#Regardless of its weight of vehicle.
#Points for vehicle kills are rewarded once there owner of the vehicle has sat in the seat has died  
#Vehicle kill is added to Killpoint instead of overiding

#--Point value
#The score each point grants the team a second
#Exclusive to GameMode-2 KOTH

#--Point contesting
#If this setting is set to anything other than 0, The Game score is the score of team 1 - the score of team 2
#If set to 0 both teams score is independant from eachother
#Simply this means if checked the score is at a tug-of-war with eachother
#An example of how this effects gameplay is a team with more score than the over but less points currently captured could
#still win the game since their score is still going up with this option set to 0
#if it was set to 1: only the team with thats currently winning in number of points captured gains score.


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Capture Point options
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


#--CapRadius
#the radius of which the base can be captured by a player.
#The visual circle of the capture radius cant be modified so its best to keep the option set to 6
#Unless you want really big cap points

#Capture time
#Time in seconds that it takes (One person-uninterupted) the base to be captured from neutral 0 to 100%
#The time taken to cap an enemy base to friendly fully is double the time (-100 to 100)
#This time is cooefficent with number of players capping


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Team Setup options
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

#--Team Name
#Names of each time represetned on the board

#--Team Color
#The color that rperesents Team

#--TeamPointNameSet 
#Purely decorative option which determins the name of the points displayed on the HUD
#The name given to the objective points on the map displaced by HUD as following reference goes:
#0 - Generic Alphabet - Warthunder - read the rules E2
#1 - NATO Alphabet - WG RD - read the rules E2
#2 - REDFOR Alphabet - WG RD - read the rules E2

#Example:
#0 - A Point,B Point,C Point,D Point
#1 - Alpha,Bravo,Charlie,Delta
#2 - Anna,Boris,Chariton,Demitri


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Getting started
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

#Placing the console
#Make sure its out of the way

#--Plan out the map
#Organize team spawn points (if possible). Spawn the objective point dupes at strategically placed places
#Reset the E2 each time you add objective points so the E2 finds and returns them all

#--Organizing teams
#Organize whos on whos side
#If desired, change the team settings in the E2
#for a player to be added to a team, he must work infont of the teams ranger and link the EGP HUD on his team side


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Capture Points
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
"Capture Points are the knife and fork of this game, giving a secondary or primary goal for the teams to accomplish
And making a tanks speed, and a players cunning vital to the games outcome unlike the meta of acf fightings"


#--What do Objective Points do?
#In gamemodes 3 and 2, Objective points are viatl to winning the game. As they grant score to the team to winning the game
#Points can otherwise refuel and restock ammo to a tank when they are captured

#--Points display visually and on HUD..
#Goes as the following:
#Static White - Neutral / uncaptured
#Static (Teams color) - Currently captured and controled by said team
#Flashing White/Team color - Currently undergoing cpature by said team
#Flashing both team colors - Being contested by both teams.

#--Capturing and contesting points
#Capturing trigger when a player is in range of the base of cpature radius (in meters)
#Capturing time is multiuplied by number of players capturing
#when a player leaves an uncaptured zone the capture slowly resets to 0 
#it takes 30 seconds for a base to reset from 99 back to 0 when the base is not captured
#When both teams are capturing a uncaptured base that means the point is being contested
#Meaning the base is not being captured and will slowly reset to 0
#when a player enters an enemy capture point he will slowly reset the capture to 0 before making it his teams (read-capturetime setting)
#if both a enemy and friendly player is in a already captured base will remain the teams until only the enemy is in the zone
#refills and refuelling services wont if both a enemy and friendly player is in a already captured base
#basically warthunder

#--Can i make my own point (decoration)?
#Yes, using the E2 provided in the wargame download folder. remember to give your point a refil ammo and fuel and wire
#those actives (and refil duty) to the E2s 'active' output


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                           Hello! You have found my secret message. Here is a link secret dupe: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KFZEERgyDbhI5ioUokVPGOEENpcOgWtC                                                             Chunder loves you ;)
#Points and scoring (KOTH/Destruction)                                                                                                                                                                                           if there is no link here then i havent done it yet. Contact chunder and say 'I have read your rulebook and found your message' I will give you the dupe personally
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
"Relative to gamemodes 1 and 2. point is how to the win the game"

#You got to kill the opponent to gain points for killing there vehicles

#Killing a infantry person will grant the team a set amount of points
#Killing a player that has been in a vehicle will grant you set amount of points plus another set amount of points for 
#destorying their vehicle
#A player that has had his vehicle destroyed and has not been yet killed should keep fighting using ACF Sweps or handheld 
#and not repsawn another tank until he has perished
#suicide is allowed to respawn

#As mentioned. capture points count towards a teams score in KOTH.


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Provided EGP TEAM HUD
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#Do not be a cheater and link your oppositions egp. only yours
#each time has an egp they link to get a HUD display which includes

#--Timer (lefthad side)
#Displays Time eclapsed (if counting up) or time remaining (if counting down)

#--Team Scores (lefthad side)
#Shows the objective goals or score or each time
#if PointContesting is set to 1, the team that is currently has the advantage shows up in its team color

#--Capture points
#3d display of where capture points are. read 'Points display visually and on HUD..'

#--TeamMates
#3d display in green of your teammates positon

#--Teammates Map pining
#simple way of preset communicating to teammates using 3d trackers. read: 'Team communication Commands'


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Team communication commands
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#I couldnt make teamside chat so this is the ebst iv got

#using Markers on map key controls:

#1 - Spotted enemy - use this when you see an emey to alert your team (3d box that flashes red and white at your aim pos)
#2 - Ping an area - Use this to bring attention to an area as follow me/ alert here, ect (3d box static white at your aim pos)
#3 - Require help - When under fire or need assistance inform you teamates( 3d box that flashes green and white at your pos)


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Winning/lose/draw (outcome critieras)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

#--A win for a team when the following is triggered:

#The score is met (if Gamemode is 1 or 2)
#All existing objective points are captured (if Gamemode 3)
#the opposite team is eliminated (if elimination)

#--When the timer expires:
#One of two things happen:
#IF the score of a team is greater than half the required score to win and 1.5 times that of the opposite team, it wins the game
#this includes no. of point captured at the end of the game if gamemode=3
#otherwise both teams draw


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Reseting the game
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#Two ways to reset the game: hard and soft resets


#Hard reset is just reseting or updating the E2 with editor
#Soft reset is the same but will keep the players currently on the teams (doesnt work with elimination) and game settings
#Both types of resets will reset the timer and capture points to neutral

#Hey guess what! Your nearly at the end of this wall of text. you deserve a reward for your time dedicated to understanting
#the game rules. so go to start of line 191 then press back arrow once til your on the next line above

#To soft reset the game. the owner of the E2 can type '!reset' or there is a inout uin the E2 if triggered will also soft reset


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Respawing
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#Respawning can de decided by the majority or the players upon an agreed set or rules. there is no set in stone rule for
#respawning besides elimination setting

#--Some suggestions on where and how players respawn:
#friendly captured points - if none then you lose
#randomly on the map
#elimination (just the game setting)
#tempory elimination until one set of team dies (dont tick elimination setting for this one)
#a dedicated respawn area on the map where the other team is prohibeted from entering (eg:safezones)


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Owner Chat commands
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Chat commands have been added in v1.11 and up to better improve gameplay and setup

#Commands start with a / - not a ! eg: '/Kick ChunderDownUndeR'

#List of commands that the owner of the wargame can use

#/Lock - Toggles Lock for player joining via the ranger walkthrough
#/Unlock - Just defaultly unlocks the action done above.
#/Kick 'player name' - Kicks a player from the game
#/add1 'player name' - remotely adds a player without them needing to walk through ranger onto team1 if they arnt already on a team
#/add2 'player name' - remotely adds a player without them needing to walk through ranger onto team2 if they arnt already on a team
#NOTE: player still needs to link to EGP and this cant be done remotely
#/reset - resets the score and cap points without losing the players or reseting the E2
#/GameMode 'number' - Changes the primary gamemode
#/'Game setting variable name' 'input' - overrides a game setting command
#eg: '/TimeLimit 10', '/Elimination 0'


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Tips and tricks to improve gameplay
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

#Remember to cloack yourself or other people spectating so they dont give away positions by flying around and looking
#Specates can link to both EGPs
#Use a good map that this game given the number of points, size and weight of tanks is elligble on
#Dont use laggy tanks if you do, you got to limit the number of players using tanks, infantry is allowed
#This game is strictly for acf. it is also good for PVP and other fights
#Yes! you can use hleicopters and non ground unit in this game if the majority is ok with it once again mind the lag
#If you dont have access to a good map, spawn props to spice up the map and fight area
#This game can mimic the games of Warthunder, wargame red dragon and world of tanks (gamemode=3,2 points,elimination)
#Announce the game settings to everyone so they understand what game they are playing
#infantry is allowed, custom handheld rules is up to you
#Infantry can also use the ACF Sweps like the 60mm anti tank GL
#Infantry can use transport! Cool!
