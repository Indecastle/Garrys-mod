# Clientside Console Screen

Has very minimal functionality on its own, designed to be imported into a project requiring a command line interface (for example both my brainfuck interpreter and sandboxed Lua "interpreter" style SFs use this for an interface)

My sandboxed Lua SF is available in this folder too, which shows a basic example of use in another project.
