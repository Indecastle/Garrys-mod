# Raytracer

Monte Carlo integration path tracer, doesn't fully work and is no longer updated as I've switched to developing a C++ binary module multi-threaded tracer which runs thousands of times faster, and produces a better result.

However the code in here should still be of use if you're writing your own SF path tracer.
